# AcciRisk
This severity prediction model harnesses a comprehensive set of parameters, including real-time weather conditions, precise geographical data, existing infrastructure such as roundabouts and u-turns, and the distance traveled, to offer a robust and accurate assessment of accident severity. By integrating these crucial factors, this project empowers decision-makers with the insights needed to enhance road safety measures, reduce accident risks, and ultimately save lives on our roadways.
