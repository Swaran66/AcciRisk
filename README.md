# üöó Improving Vehicle Crash Severity Prediction using Machine Learning Models

## üìå Project Overview

Crash severity prediction is crucial for proactive road safety management and emergency planning. However, challenges such as inconsistent data collection and extreme class imbalance reduce the generalizability of traditional models.

This project addresses these issues through:
- A **standardized feature mapping** process
- Advanced **class imbalance handling**
- A **stacked ensemble modeling framework** to enhance prediction accuracy

## üîç What Makes This Project Unique

This project distinguishes itself through several innovative approaches:

- **Standardized Feature Mapping**  
  Addressing the inconsistency in crash data collected from various agencies, this project implements a standardized framework for feature mapping. This harmonization ensures that the predictive models are trained on consistent and reliable data, enhancing their generalizability.

- **Advanced Imbalance Handling Techniques**  
  Recognizing the challenge posed by the natural imbalance in crash data‚Äîwhere severe crashes are less frequent‚Äîthe project employs both minority downsampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). These methods effectively balance the dataset, allowing the models to learn from both common and rare events.

- **Stacked Ensemble Modeling**  
  The project leverages a stacked ensemble approach, combining multiple base learners with a meta-learner. This technique captures diverse patterns in the data, leading to improved predictive performance over individual models.

- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**  
  Beyond traditional accuracy, the project utilizes metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)** to provide a nuanced assessment of model performance, especially important in imbalanced datasets.

By integrating these methodologies, the project offers a robust and scalable solution for predicting crash severity, contributing valuable insights to the field of traffic safety and emergency response planning.
